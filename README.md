# BioSonic
A python package for bioacoustics


## Description


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

BioSonic is written to be lightweight and only relies on numpy (>= 1.26)and scipy (>= 1.12) for the basic functionality. If you want plotting and more advanced features, or praat implementations, this can be specified during pip installing:

```
pip install biosonic[praat]

```

Python 3.10 and above are supported. Python 3.9 may be prone to some errors due to type checking but can be used with caution. 

### Installing



### Executing

For now, inside your downloaded package root directory: 
```
pip install -e . 
```
